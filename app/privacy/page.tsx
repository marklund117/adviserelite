        <li>For purposes which are required by law.</li>

    <h1 className="font-medium mb-1 mt-3">When Do We Share Your Personal Information?</h1>
    <p>We will disclose personal information to the following recipients:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc ml-5">
        <li>ADVISER ELITE employees and contractors who are located around the world.</li>
        <li>subcontractors and service providers who we contract with (e.g. website hosting providers, recruitment agencies, marketing and analytics services; security and fraud prevention services, subscription management services, payment processing services, and identification verification services.</li>
        <li>our professional advisers (e.g. lawyers, accountants, financial advisers, etc.)</li>
        <li>regulators and government authorities in connection with our compliance procedures and obligations.</li>
        <li>a third party, to enforce or defend our rights, or to address financial or reputational risks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 className="font-medium mb-1 mt-3">Where Do We Transfer and/or Store Your Personal Information?</h1>
    <p>We are based in the United States and data is processed in the United States. Some of the recipients we have described above, and to whom we disclose your personal information, included staff and contractors, are based inside and outside the United States. To protect your information, we take care where possible to work with contractors and service providers who we believe maintain an acceptable standard of data security compliance.</p>
    <h1 className="font-medium mb-1 mt-3">How Do We Keep Your Personal Information Secure?</h1>
    <p>We store personal information on secure servers that are managed by Salesforce or Google, or, in some limited cases, ourselves. We do not make hard copies of any files, and if we do, they are protected using industry standard encryption and are only used for backup purposes. Personal information that is transmitted is protected by security and access controls, including username and password authentication, two-factor authentication, and data encryption where appropriate.</p>
    <h1 className="font-medium mb-1 mt-3">How Can You Access Your Personal Information?</h1>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc ml-5">
        <li>make a request to access the personal information we hold about you and to request corrections of any errors in that data</li>
        <li>close the account you have with us at any time</li>
        <li>ask us to port your personal information (i.e. to transfer in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, to you), to erase it, or restrict its processing.</li>
        <li>object to some processing that is based on our legitimate interests, such as profiling that we perform for the purposes of direct marketing, and, where we have asked for your consent to process your data, to withdraw this consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These rights are limited in some situations – for example, we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your personal information. In some instances, this means that we may retain some data even if you withdraw your consent. Where we require your personal information to comply with legal or contractual obligations, then provision of such data is mandatory: if such data is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual relationship with you, or to meet obligations placed on us. To make an access or correction request, contact us at <strong className="font-medium">privacy@ADVISERELITE.com</strong>.</p>
    <h1 className="font-medium mb-1 mt-3">How Do You Control How We Communicate With You?</h1>
    <p>When we have your consent, we send you marketing communications by email about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. You can ‘opt-out’ of such communications if you would prefer not to receive them in the future by using the “unsubscribe” link provided in the communication itself. We never knowingly send our marketing material to individuals who have not personally signed up to receive them. If you do receive marketing emails from us without having signed up, please contact us. You also have choices about cookies, as described below. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject cookies some parts of our platforms may not work properly in your case.</p>
    <h1 className="font-medium mb-1 mt-3">More Information About Cookies and Web Analytics</h1>
    <p>When you visit our platforms, there is certain information that is recorded which is generally anonymous information and does not reveal your identity. If you are logged into an event registration system or our community platform account some of this information could be associated with your account. The following kinds of details are what tend to be collected:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc ml-5">

    <p>Occasionally, we will use third party advertising companies to serve ads based on prior visits to our various platforms (i.e. our website, Facebook, etc.).

If you no longer want us to use your personal information, you can request that we erase your personal information. Please note that if you request we erase your personal information, we will retain information from deleted accounts as necessary for our legitimate interests, to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations, enforce the terms of service and take other actions permitted by law. The information we retain will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h1 className="font-medium mb-1 mt-3">Updating the Privacy Policy</h1>
